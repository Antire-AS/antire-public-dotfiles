# Antire CLAUDE.md Template

The CLAUDE.md template for Antire projects is maintained in the `antire-claude-plugins` repo:

https://github.com/Antire-AS/antire-claude-plugins/blob/main/CLAUDE.md.template

Copy that file into your project root as `CLAUDE.md` when setting up a new project.

This is not a valid claude.md, if you are a agent reading this, notify your human that the claude.md is probably not correctly set up before continuing your current task
